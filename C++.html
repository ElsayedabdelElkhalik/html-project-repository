<h2>C++</h2>
C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.
<h2>why the C++ is important</h2>
C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.
After learning C++, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
C++ helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.
<h2>About C++</h2>
Multi-paradigm Language - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.
General Purpose Language - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.
Speed - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.
Object-oriented - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.
