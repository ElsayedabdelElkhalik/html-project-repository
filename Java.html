<h2>Java:</h2>
Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.
<h2>WHAT MAKES LEARNING IT IMPORTANT?</h2>
Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-based applications with JSP (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which can then perform a function not normally available.

Programs that use or are written in Java include Adobe Creative Suite, Eclipse, Lotus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice.
Java is the core foundation for developing Android apps.
Features:
Application portability
Robust and interpreted language
Extensive network library
<h2>Main uses of Java</h2>
It is easy for developers to write programs which employ popular software design patterns and best practices using the various components found in Java EE. For example, frameworks such as Struts and JavaServer Faces all use a Java servlet to implement the front controller design pattern for centralizing requests.

A big part of the Java ecosystem is the large variety of open source and community built projects, software platforms and APIs. For example, the Apache Foundation hosts a variety of projects written using Java, including simple logging frameworks for Java (SLF4J), both Yarn and Hadoop processing frameworks, Microservices development platforms and integration platforms.
